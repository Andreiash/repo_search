# repo_search
Get the availability of a package across multiple systems.

This is a https://repology.org scraper that you can use in your terminal to check if a piece of software it's available on certain distro/OS.
It can also show the link to each repository if you edit the script by changing the shebang to bash and search for "non-POSIX".
